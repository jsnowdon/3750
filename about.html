                <b>Our mission:</b><br>
                We plan to unite the community at large with the local school boards.
                This will be done through the creation of educational activities in the
                form of projects. These projects are laid out below by category, and all
                active projects can be viewed on the site.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>What is the purpose:</b><br>
                Here at KidTribute we aim to bring the community together with schools.
                We allow community members to easily get involved by creating accounts
                on our system, which will allow teachers to find them and invite them
                to assist students with a project.<br>
                A project is a medium of communication between community members and
                teachers. They allow a teacher to post relevant information for all
                to view about what they need accomplished and when it needs to be
                done by.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>How it works:</b><br>
                Principals commissioned by the school board will begin by creating teacher
                accounts for teachers who wish to begin a new project. Teachers who create
                a new project can pick and choose from community members within the system.
                These community members can accept or reject a request to join a project.
                If a community member wishes to join a project, but the teacher has not yet
                found them, the community member can reach out to the teacher through the
                email listed by the teacher and ask for a request.<br>
                Anyone can be a community member. Those wishing to be a community member
                simply need to click the "Create Account" button and fill in the required
                information!<br>
                If you are just visiting, you can browse the selection of active projects
                by clicking one of the catagory buttons located on the home page or search
                for more specific projects using the search bar located at the top of the
                web page.
